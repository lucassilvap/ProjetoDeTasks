## README


## What is this repository for?
1. This repository contains some code. It might be compiling or not :)

### Before you start

- The project must use the specific language in the assessment. For example: Python, R, Scala, and others;
- Consider the assessment deadline starting from the beginning of the test. If you have been invited to take the test and cannot complete it within this period, notify the person who invited you to receive instructions on what to do.
- Document the entire investigation process for the development of the activity (README.md in your repository); the results of these tasks are as important as your thought process and decisions as you complete them, so try to document and present your hypotheses and decisions as much as possible.

## Contribution guidelines and Tips

1. All tips and contributions are welcome. But be aware that existing errors might not be an accident. We would appreciate if you let us know anything that you realize during the exam. We expect that and it could raise your interview evaluation up.

## Repository README

- Should contain the project title
- A project description in a sentence
